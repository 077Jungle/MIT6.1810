In g(x), x is contained in register a0.
In f(x), x is contained in register a0. 
In printf(), 13 is contained in register a2, f(8)+1 is contained in a1. 

call to function f: 
  24:	4635                	li	a2,13
call to function g: 
  26:	45b1                	li	a1,12

prtinf() is located at 0x64a. 

$a0 = 2032;
x *$a0 => "%d %d\n"

// the RISC-V is little-endian
He110 World
// if big-endian
unsigned int i = 0x726c6400;
no need

register a2 is arbitrary.
